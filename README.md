# Opportunistic: Routing Distribution, Broadcasts, Transmissions and Receptions in an Opportunistic Network

This repository contains the Opportunistic R package, which provides
user-friendly functions to access the methods proposed in the research
work titled “A novel theoretical probabilistic model for opportunistic
routing with applications in energy consumption for WSNs” by Galarza et
al. (2021) \[1\].

## Installation

To use the Opportunistic R package, you need to have R software
installed on your system. If you don’t have it, you can download it from
the [R project website](https://cloud.r-project.org/). Alternatively,
you can compile R online using platforms such as [RStudio
cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.to/r).

Once you have R installed, you can install the Opportunistic package by
running the following code in the R console:

``` r
# Install from CRAN
library(Opportunistic)

# Or the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chedgala/Opportunistic")
```

## Usage

After installing the package, you can load it using the following
command:

``` r
library(Opportunistic)
```

The package provides three main functions:

1.  `routes(p, delta)`: This function returns the different possible
    routes, their frequency, and their respective probabilities when
    considering uncertain probabilities lying on the interval
    `p ± delta`. It is based on the theoretical framework developed in
    the research work.

2.  `Expected(p)`: This function calculates the probability of
    successful transmissions and the expected number of transmissions,
    receptions, and broadcasts for the given vector of probabilities
    `p`.

3.  `MonteCarlo(p, M)`: This function estimates the probability of
    successful transmissions, as well as the expected number of
    transmissions, receptions, and broadcasts using Monte Carlo
    simulations. The parameter `M` specifies the number of simulations
    to perform.

For more information on the usage and capabilities of the Opportunistic
R package, please refer to the package documentation and the original
research work \[1\].

## Tutorial

This section shows how to access the methods proposed in this work through available user functions.

``` r
library(Opportunistic)
#An N=5 Opportunistic system with probabilities
> p <- c(0.85, 0.72, 0.50, 0.28, 0.05)
> routes(p) # routes distribution

           Freq Probability   Value
route 1       1        p1^5 0.44371
route 2       4     p1^3*p2 0.44217
route 3       3     p1*p2^2 0.44064
route 4       3     p1^2*p3 0.36125
route 5       2       p2*p3    0.36
route 6       2       p1*p4   0.238
route 7       1          p5    0.05
Total        16
```

``` r
#An N=5 Opportunistic system with probabilities
> p <- c(0.85, 0.72, 0.50, 0.28, 0.05)
> True = Expected(p)
